<h5>Student</h5>
<p>
Fit for Green will encourage members to join forces with friends and family in order to make working out and creating energy fun.  For some friends it may be all about the competition and for others it may be more about cooperation around some renewable energy creation goal that they have set as a unit.  In either case the friends become a new driver to help members get healthier and at the same time contribute to a united renewable energy cause / effort.
