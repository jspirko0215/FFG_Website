<p>
Welcome to our website, Fit for Green's main objective is to create a new gym 
experience, giving gym members a good feeling about helping the environment and a
new way to compete while working out on otherwise ordinary gym equipment. 
These new incentives inevitably increase the frequency of workouts and help 
contribute to a more fit generation.  
</p>
<p>
We market gym equipment that generates electricity to commercial gymnasiums; mostly
elliptical trainers and stationary bikes.  The equipment is unique because it reports 
metrics, such as watts generated, calories burned, and miles traveled, into a global 
database.  The collected data feeds a social media site that users sign-in to in order
to view their metrics and interact with others.
</p>
<p>
End users use their metrics, in the form of points, to compete in virtual internet 
competitions within the Fit for Green social media game.  Competitions are against 
other individuals, against another social group, or against piers in sponsored competitions.
