<p>
While the actual website is still in design, this website is being updated to reflect
the current state of the requirements.  This will help demonstrate the user experience 
of the actual site.  There will be three user types that interact with the Fit for Green
website:
</p>

<p>
    <a href="/promo/coming_soon/">End Users</a> - The users of the gym equipment and the site.  Theses users will sign-on to create and maintain a profile, register for groups or sponsored competitions, and have access to their rankings and their team's rankings in each competition.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="/promo/coming_soon/">Group Admins</a> - Group admins will be users that create a group of their own.  There will be set limitations on the size of these groups.  On the Group Admin page admins can start competitions within the group or challenge other groups.  For example gym versus gym or school versus school.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="/promo/coming_soon/">Sponsors</a> - In contrast to groups sponsors will be able to target certain demographics and create contests for the targeted users.  The contests will be for prizes that the sponsor offers.  On the sponsor page there will also be promotional capabilities so they can promote their product(s), to their target user group, throughout the competition.
